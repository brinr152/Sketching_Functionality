    I spent a lot of my time playing around with the set up of my date points and getting them arragened into the grid. I didn't get too far into styling, but I was able to add my classes and understand how that portion will work. 

    <div id="container"></div>
    <script src="lib/airtable.browser.js"></script>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
